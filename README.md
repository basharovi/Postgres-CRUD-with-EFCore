# Postgres-CRUD-with-EFCore
--------------------

Entity Framework (EF) Core is a lightweight, extensible, open source and cross-platform version of the popular Entity Framework data access technology. it is a modern object-database mapper for .NET. It supports LINQ queries, change tracking, updates, and schema migrations. EF Core works with SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, SQLite, Azure Cosmos DB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other databases through a provider plugin API.

### Usually. we use EF Core with SQL Server Databases, but here I have tried to use it with PostgreSQL.
